'''
Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers.
The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

Bonus Challenge: Is it possible to find the max and min in a single traversal?
'''
def get_min_max(ints):
    """
    Return a tuple(min, max) out of list of unsorted integers.

    Args:
       ints(list): list of integers containing one or more integers
    """
   print(ints)

## Example Test Case of Ten Integers
import random

l = [i for i in range(0, 10)]  # a list containing 0 - 9
random.shuffle(l)

print ("Pass" if ((0, 9) == get_min_max(l)) else "Fail")

#Sorting usually requires O(n log n) time Can you come up with a O(n) algorithm (i.e., linear time)?
